Lists:

Lists are ordered collections of items.
They are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove items after the list is created.
Lists are defined using square brackets [ ].
Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Tuples:

Tuples are ordered collections of items, similar to lists.
However, they are immutable, meaning once created, you cannot change, add, or remove items.
Tuples are defined using parentheses ( ).
Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Dictionaries:

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
They are mutable and allow you to store and retrieve values using unique keys.
Dictionaries are defined using curly braces { }, with key-value pairs separated by colons : and individual pairs separated by commas ,.
Example: my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
Here's a summary of the differences between them:

Mutability: Lists and dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after creation. Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed once they are created.

Order: Lists and tuples are ordered collections, meaning the order of elements is preserved. Dictionaries are unordered, meaning there is no guarantee on the order of key-value pairs.

Accessing Elements: Lists and tuples are accessed by index, while dictionaries are accessed by key.

Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets [ ], tuples are defined using parentheses ( ), and dictionaries are defined using curly braces { }.
