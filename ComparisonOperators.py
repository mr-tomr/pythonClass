# Define two numbers

# Equal to: Checks if two numbers are equal
equal_to = num1 == num2
print(f"{num1} is equal to {num2}: {equal_to}")

# Not equal to: Checks if two numbers are not equal

# Less than: Checks if the first number is less than the second
less_than = num1 < num2
print(f"{num1} is less than {num2}: {less_than}")

# Less than or equal to: Checks if the first number is less than or equal to the second
